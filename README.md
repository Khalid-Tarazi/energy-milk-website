# 🎮 Spylt-Inspired Website

This project is a **modern, interactive web experience** built using **React**, **GSAP animations**, and **Tailwind CSS** — inspired by the incredible design and motion work of [Spylt](https://www.spylt.com/).  
I followed a tutroial, and my goal was to recreate and learn from Spylt’s advanced UI/UX techniques while adding personal touches and improvements.
